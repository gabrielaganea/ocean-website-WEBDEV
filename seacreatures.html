                <p style="margin-left: 50px; width: 500px;"> Corals are marine invertebrates that come in different shapes, sizes and colors. Often mistaken for plants, corals are in fact animals, most closely related to jellyfish and anemones. However, they don't age, they constantly regenerate. Although reefs cover less than 2% of the ocean bottom, one-quarter of all ocean species depend on them. </p>
                <p style="margin-left: 50px; width: 500px;"> The large coral reefs seem to be the oldest living animals in the world. Their longevity is 541 to 485.4 million years. Corals can get easily stressed. If the water temperatures rises, corals stress and they turn white. If the condition returns to normal, corals can get back their color. </p>

                <p style="margin-right: 50px; width: 500px;"> Many parts of a coral reef can be harvested to make medications. According to the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration: "Coral reef plants and animals are important sources of new medicines being developed to treat cancer, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, heart disease, viruses, and other diseases." The quality of the water is also improved by coral reefs, by filtering out the things that are floating in the ocean's water. </p>
                <p style="margin-right: 50px; width: 500px;"> Coral reefs help the marine plants to survive, stabilizing the sea bed and preventing it from getting washed-out while also lessening the impact of storms. Those plants also provide food and protection for countles marine animals. </p>
