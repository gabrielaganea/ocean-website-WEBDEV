          Corals are marine invertebrates that come in different shapes, sizes
          and colors. Often mistaken for plants, corals are in fact animals,
          most closely related to jellyfish and anemones. However, they don't
          age, they constantly regenerate. Although reefs cover less than 2% of
          the ocean bottom, one-quarter of all ocean species depend on them.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 50px; width: 400px">
          The large coral reefs seem to be the oldest living animals in the
          world. Their longevity is 541 to 485.4 million years. Corals can get
          easily stressed. If the water temperatures rises, corals stress and
          they turn white. If the condition returns to normal, corals can get
          back their color.

          Many parts of a coral reef can be harvested to make medications.
          According to the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration: "Coral
          reef plants and animals are important sources of new medicines being
          developed to treat cancer, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, heart
          disease, viruses, and other diseases." The quality of the water is
          also improved by coral reefs, by filtering out the things that are
          floating in the ocean's water.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-right: 50px; width: 400px">
          Coral reefs help the marine plants to survive, stabilizing the sea bed
          and preventing it from getting washed-out while also lessening the
          impact of storms. Those plants also provide food and protection for
          countles marine animals.

          <h2>1980</h2>
          <p>
            FIRST MASS CORAL BLEACHING EVENT. Terry Hughes, director of the ARC
            Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies stated that "Before the
            1980s, mass bleaching of corals was unheard of". Before, these
            bleaching events were rare, occurring at a rate of once every 25 to
            30 years. Now mass coral bleaching events happen about every six
            years, far too fast for ecosystems to recover.

          <h2>1997-1998</h2>
          <p>
            FIRST GLOBAL EVENT. One of the hottest summers in the 20th century
            was recorded. Reports of record levels of coral bleaching in the
            eastern Pacific began to pour in during late 1997. Mild bleaching
            began in late January of 1998, intensifying by February. During this
            event 16% of corals reefs have been lost. Most reefs recovered
            fully.

          <h2>2002</h2>
          <p>
            NOT A GLOBAL EVENT. This bleaching event was slightly more severe
            than the one in 1998. Around 60% of the Great Barrier reef showed
            bleaching on central and inshore areas. Reports show that the firs
            signs were in january, but the worst was over in April. Fewer than
            5% suffered high mortality, in the Bowen area being the worst
            affected, where around 70% of corals died.

          <p>
            NOT A GLOBAL EVENT. In 2005, half of all the Caribbean coral reefs
            in the United States were lost. In January and February 2006,
            significant coral deaths due to bleaching, around 30-40%, were
            recorded in the Keppel Islands. The degree of bleaching was worse
            than in previous years.

          <h2>2010-2011</h2>
          <p>
            SECOND GLOBAL EVENT. During this event, the most affected places
            were in Southeast Asia and Western Australia. For several reefs this
            was the first recorded coral bleaching, inlcuding the Nigaloo reef.
            The Great Barrier Reef dodged a bullet during this event. In 2011,
            bleaching was caused by an influx of freshwater.

          <p>
            THIRD GLOBAL EVENT. The longest and deadliest bleaching event to
            ever be recorded in history. The event started in the summer of
            2014, in the North Pacific. Extensive coral bleaching in Hawaii has
            been documented in November 2015. In June 2016 the coral morality
            for the entire Great Barrier reef was at 22%. By 2017, the central
            third of the Great Barrier Reef was affected.

          El Niño is a natural phenomenon occuring every five years or so that
          causes sea surface temperatures to rise in the equatorial Pacific
          Ocean. As the climate warms, the risk of bleaching during El Niño
          years is rapidly increasing.
